# Exploration of the Use of Large Language Models(LLMS) for Occupational Code Classification

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in natural language processing, enabling advancements in automated tasks like occupational code classification.Traditional methods of classifying occupations, such as International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), International Standard Classification of Education(ISCED) and  International Standard of Industrial Classification(ISIC) rely on manual input, which can be inefficient and error-prone. By using Large Language Models, job titles, descriptions, and Education can be automatically analyzed and assigned accurate occupational codes, improving efficiency and scalability.

This project explores the use of LLMs for occupational code classification within Rwanda’s labor market. It aims to enhance the accuracy and speed of classification, providing valuable insights for labor market analysis and supporting informed policy-making. As part of NISR’s Big Data and Data Revolution department which is responsible for fostering innovations, this project will contribute to the ongoing advancements in data-driven solutions.
